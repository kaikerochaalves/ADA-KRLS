# ADA-KRLS (adaptive dynamic adjustment kernel recursive least squares)

The adaptive dynamic adjustment kernel recursive least squares (ADA-KRLS) is a model proposed by Han et al. [1].

- [Runtime_AllDatasets](https://github.com/kaikerochaalves/QKRLS/blob/6a1dcf72ecebd8473dc447df32b17ebb5b91e67a/Runtime_AllDatasets.py) perform 30 simulations for each dataset and compute the mean runtime and the standard deviation.

- [MackeyGlass](https://github.com/kaikerochaalves/QKRLS/blob/6a1dcf72ecebd8473dc447df32b17ebb5b91e67a/MackeyGlass.py) is the script to prepare the Mackey-Glass time series, perform simulations, compute the results and plot the graphics. 

- [Nonlinear](https://github.com/kaikerochaalves/QKRLS/blob/6a1dcf72ecebd8473dc447df32b17ebb5b91e67a/Nonlinear.py) is the script to prepare the nonlinear dynamic system identification time series, perform simulations, compute the results and plot the graphics.

- [LorenzAttractor](https://github.com/kaikerochaalves/QKRLS/blob/6a1dcf72ecebd8473dc447df32b17ebb5b91e67a/LorenzAttractor.py) is the script to prepare the Lorenz Attractor time series, perform simulations, compute the results and plot the graphics.
